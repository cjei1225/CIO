The next module is the document management module. The module enables the system
to manage the documents of each user. The module would make use of a tagging feature
as well as a system generated serial code for each document which will make search for
certain documents easier. The module also features an audit trail that will inform the user
of the changes or actions that were done on the document. The module includes a
notification feature which lets the user know when a new document has been uploaded
or, in the case of the medical staff users, when it is requested. Lastly, the module would have a checklist of documents to assist the social worker in identifying what documents are still missing and what documents are already on hand.
